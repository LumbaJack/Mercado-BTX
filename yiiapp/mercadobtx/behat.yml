# Configuration file for Behat.

# Behat is loaded with MinkExtension
# Normal session is Goutte
# Javascript session is Selenium2
# You have two profiles: frontend and backend
# callable as `bin/behat -p frontend` and `bin/behat -p backend`, respectively.
# For Selenium to find your web application you have to make `behat-local.yml`
# config and put a base_url definition there.
# Example of `behat-local.yml` you can see in `carcass/vagrant/`.
