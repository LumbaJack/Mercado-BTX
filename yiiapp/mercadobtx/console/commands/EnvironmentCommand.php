USAGE
	yiic environment
	yiic environment set --id=ENV_ID

DESCRIPTION
	Manages the current environment for application. Changing the environment changes the set of additional overrides
	defined in the `config/overrides/environment.php` of each entry point.

	Basically, when you change the environment, to, say, `dev`, then the `dev.php` configuration file will be extracted
	from `config/environments/` subdirectory, and copied to `config/overrides/` subdirectory with the new name
	`environment.php`. This will be done for common config as well as for each individual entry point, effectively
	installing new set of overrides for base configuration across the whole application.

	Please note that environment configuration is not your local development settings like the connection settings
	for DBMS at your workstation. It's the config which will be put into the VCS repo and is intended mainly
	to differentiate between the production setup where massive micro-optimization and no debug is expected
	and development setup where the situation is quite the opposite.
